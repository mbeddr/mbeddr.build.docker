# mbeddr.build.docker

This repository contains the source code for the Docker images used to build mbeddr and other MPS-based projects. It is
basically a TeamCity build agent with some additional packages for compiling the generated Java and C code.

Using the image to run a TeamCity agent is fairly simple:

```
docker pull mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker
docker run --name buildAgent1 -d --restart=always -e AGENT_NAME=awesomeAgent mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker
```

If you run Docker on a storage backend that supports size limits for the volumes it makes sense to limit the available
disk space for the agent:

```
docker pull mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker
docker run --name buildAgent1 -d --restart=always --storage-opt size=50G -e AGENT_NAME=awesomeAgent mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker
```

The agent gets its name from the environment variable `AGENT_NAME`. This name will show up in the teamcity web ui. If
you don't set the name you will endup with a agent called `placeholder`.

# Installed JDKs

These JDKs are installed:
- OpenJDK 8 at $JAVA_HOME (default, used by the TeamCity agent)
- JetBrains Runtime (JDK) 11 at $JB_JAVA11_HOME
- JetBrains Runtime (JDK) 17 at $JB_JAVA17_HOME

MPS requires JDK 8 up to version 2019.1 but requires JDK 11 since version 2019.2. Since 2022.2 MPS requires JDK 17.

You can configure a build step in TeamCity to use a specific non-default JDK.

Builds using a recent version of [`mps-gradle-plugin`](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin/) can specify the JVM
to use for a particular invocation of MPS by setting the `executable` parameter (see the [documentation of the
`RunAntScript` task](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin/#runantscript)). This makes it possible to build
different branches of the same project with different JDKs without having to duplicate build configurations.
